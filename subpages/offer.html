    <div class="tekst_proton">
    
    <p>Electronics intended for the space industry must withstand the environmental conditions in space, especially the effects of cosmic rays.
         This is especially important when designing electronics for deep space missions where there is no Earth's magnetic protective field.
          As one of the few in the world, we offer an exclusive service of testing and hardening electronic circuits using a proton beam.
           We also offer consulting services related to the design and manufacture of space devices and the selection of materials.
