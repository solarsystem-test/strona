        <h3 class="text1">Over 80 times cost reduction</h3>
        <p>of the launch of the rocket into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) since 1980. Once Starship is established, 50 further cost reductions are expected.
             This is as if a $ 320k luxury car got cheaper to $ 8k and then $ 160. The door to space has been opened.</p>

        <p>Currently, not only the richest government agencies of the largest economic powers can operate in space. Today even students launch their devices into space. 
            There are hundreds, if not thousands, of space companies in the world. This new era of exploration has been named by NASA as Space 2.0 and by ESA as Space 4.0.</p>

        <h3 class="text1">366 B$/y space sector</h3>
        <p>The current value of the space sector is $ 366 billion per year (2019 data), of which $ 271 billion is the satellite technology market.
             The space sector is dynamically developing and accelerating more and more.
             The completion of the mega satellite constellation, the Starship vehicle, the NASA Artemis program and space mining will greatly accelerate this growth.</p>

        <h3 class="text1">200 B$ lunar water market</h3>
        <p>Mega satellite constellations under construction. They will be composed of several to tens of thousands of small satellites.
             Most of the projects will be completed within a few years from today. It is estimated that 20-25% of satellites in mega constellations each year will have to be replaced for various reasons, as reflected in the business models. The main reason - the exhaustion of fuel for maneuvering engines. Being able to refuel them in orbit means savings in the billions. For this purpose and for refueling spacecraft, fuel obtained from water from ice contained in lunar craters will be used.
             The lunar water market (according to the WGM report) for the next 30 years is $ 200 billion.</p>

    <p>A NASA radar aboard India's Chandrayaan-I lunar orbiter found 40 craters, ranging in size from 1 to 9 miles across, with pockets of ice.
         Scientists estimate at least 600 million tons of ice could be entombed in these crater, and other higher-end estimates say one billion metric tons is a possibility.</p>

    <h3 class="text1">1/3 annual GDP of all mankind</h3>
    <p>The platinum group metals that are needed for the development of modern technology (specialist metal alloys, electronics, etc.) are running out of shortages on Earth.
         These resources are abundant in space - they are found on the Moon, Mars and asteroids. Some asteroids are large in size. The value of one of such giants was estimated at 1/3 of the annual GDP of all mankind.
         Small asteroids can also be very valuable. For example, the price of 1 ton of platinum is $ 27 M (the price at the end of Q3 2020).</p>

        <h3 class="text1">100 B$ per one person on Earth</h3>
        <p>In 2018, on one of NASA's subpages, there was a sensational information that there may be space resources worth 100 billion dollars per one person on Earth.
             No one really knows how much raw material is in space, so NASA quickly withdrew this information.
             Even if the estimate is incorrect by several orders of value, these are still unimaginable amounts and sums of money.</p>

<div class="facts" id="techno">
        <h3 class="text1">Basic technology available</h3>
        <p>The technology needed for the exploration of the Moon and Mars exploration and colonization was already available in the 1970s.
             Most of the solutions used in space mining will be based on those known from terrestrial mining. Improvements will be in materials, electronics (demanding space environment), and especially in robotics and system autonomy.
             The devices will be improved in terms of reliability, operational and economic efficiency.</p>
